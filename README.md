We offer system programming training classes by the two trainers.

Satoshi Tanda is a system software engineer and a security researcher with more than a decade of experience. He devotes himself to developing and reverse engineering system software. For example, he authored [multiple](https://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform) [open source](https://github.com/tandasat/SimpleSvm) [hypervisors](https://github.com/tandasat/MiniVisorPkg) [for researchers](https://github.com/tandasat/MiniVisorPkg), and discovered an [SMM vulnerability](https://github.com/tandasat/SmmExploit).

Bruce Dang is the co-instructor of the classes. At this time, he is unavailable for synchronous classes.
