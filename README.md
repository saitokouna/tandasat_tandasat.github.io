## About the Trainer

Satoshi, the trainer, is a system software engineer and security researcher with over 15+ years of experience. He works for virtualization and security as a platform engineer for game console security and previously worked at security software vendors as a developer, researcher, and reverse engineer, and led "low-level" projects like UEFI inspection on Windows.

He enjoys developing and reverse engineering system software. In particular, his strong interest in platform security led him to devote himself to learning virtualization technologies and writing research hypervisors since 2009 (there was even no EPT at the time!). In recent years, he developed [multiple](https://github.com/tandasat/HyperPlatform) [open-source](https://github.com/tandasat/SimpleSvm) [hypervisors](https://github.com/tandasat/MiniVisorPkg) [for researchers](https://github.com/tandasat/MiniVisorPkg), detailed [applications](https://github.com/tandasat/Hypervisor-101-in-Rust) and [progression](https://github.com/tandasat/Hello-VT-rp) of virtualization technologies, and discovered [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/tandasat/CVE-2024-21305) [in hypervisors](https://github.com/tandasat/CVE-2023-36427) and [SMM](https://github.com/tandasat/SmmExploit), an even more privileged component. He has taught the class for over a hundred professionals online as well as at reputable security conferences such as [OffensiveCon](https://www.offensivecon.org/), [Recon](https://recon.cx/), and [Hexacon](https://www.hexacon.fr/).
